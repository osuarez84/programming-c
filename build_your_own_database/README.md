# Build Your Own Database: A Step-by-Step Learning Path

This project guides you through building a basic relational database management system (RDBMS) from scratch. By completing these lessons, you'll gain deep insights into how databases work internally, their core components, and how these components interact with each other.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental architecture of a database system
- Learn about storage engines, query processing, and transaction management
- Implement core database components incrementally
- Develop practical skills in data structures, algorithms, and system design

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate programming skills in C
- Basic understanding of data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees)
- Familiarity with file I/O operations
- Understanding of memory management concepts

## Project Structure

Each lesson focuses on a specific component of the database system, with exercises designed to reinforce understanding and build toward a functional RDBMS.

## Lesson 1: Database Fundamentals and Storage Engine Basics

**Theory:**
- Database architecture overview
- Storage models (row-based vs. column-based)
- Page-based storage systems
- Disk vs. memory considerations

**Exercises:**
1. Create a simple page structure to store data
2. Implement basic file I/O operations for reading/writing pages
3. Design a basic record format

**Milestone:** A program that can store and retrieve simple records from disk using a page-based approach.

## Lesson 2: Buffer Pool Management

**Theory:**
- Memory hierarchy in database systems
- Buffer pool design and purpose
- Page replacement policies (LRU, Clock, etc.)
- Dirty page tracking

**Exercises:**
1. Implement a buffer pool manager
2. Create a page table to track loaded pages
3. Implement a simple LRU eviction policy
4. Add dirty page tracking and write-back functionality

**Milestone:** A buffer pool that efficiently manages memory and reduces disk I/O operations.

## Lesson 3: B-Tree Indexes

**Theory:**
- Index structures overview
- B-Tree properties and operations
- Balancing algorithms
- Search optimization

**Exercises:**
1. Implement a B-Tree node structure
2. Create insert operation for B-Tree
3. Implement search functionality
4. Add delete operation with rebalancing

**Milestone:** A functional B-Tree index that can efficiently store, retrieve, and delete keys.

## Lesson 4: Table and Record Management

**Theory:**
- Table structure design
- Record formats (fixed-length vs. variable-length)
- Schema management
- Record operations (insert, update, delete)

**Exercises:**
1. Design a table metadata structure
2. Implement record serialization/deserialization
3. Create record insertion with space management
4. Add record deletion and update operations

**Milestone:** A system that can manage tables with records of different schemas.

## Lesson 5: Query Processing Basics

**Theory:**
- Query execution pipeline
- Parsing and syntax trees
- Simple query execution strategies
- Sequential scan implementation

**Exercises:**
1. Implement a simple query parser for basic SELECT statements
2. Create a sequential scan operator
3. Add simple predicate evaluation
4. Implement projection of columns

**Milestone:** A basic query processor that can execute simple SELECT queries.

## Lesson 6: Query Optimization

**Theory:**
- Query optimization principles
- Statistics collection and usage
- Cost-based optimization basics
- Join algorithms (nested loop, hash join)

**Exercises:**
1. Implement statistics collection for tables
2. Create a simple cost estimator
3. Add index-based access path selection
4. Implement a basic nested loop join

**Milestone:** A query optimizer that can make basic decisions about execution plans.

## Lesson 7: Transaction Management

**Theory:**
- ACID properties
- Concurrency control mechanisms
- Lock-based concurrency control
- Deadlock detection and prevention

**Exercises:**
1. Implement a transaction manager
2. Add two-phase locking protocol
3. Create a lock table and manager
4. Implement deadlock detection

**Milestone:** A transaction system that ensures data consistency during concurrent operations.

## Lesson 8: Recovery System

**Theory:**
- Logging strategies
- Write-ahead logging (WAL)
- Checkpoint mechanisms
- Recovery procedures

**Exercises:**
1. Implement a log manager
2. Create log record formats for different operations
3. Add checkpoint functionality
4. Implement recovery from crash

**Milestone:** A recovery system that can restore the database to a consistent state after a crash.

## Lesson 9: SQL Interface

**Theory:**
- SQL language basics
- Parser and lexer design
- Query compilation
- Result set management

**Exercises:**
1. Extend the parser to handle more SQL constructs
2. Implement a basic SQL compiler
3. Add support for more complex queries
4. Create a client interface for SQL execution

**Milestone:** A SQL interface that allows users to interact with your database using standard SQL queries.

## Lesson 10: Putting It All Together

**Theory:**
- System integration
- Performance tuning
- Benchmarking
- Advanced database features

**Exercises:**
1. Integrate all components into a cohesive system
2. Implement a simple client application
3. Benchmark your database against simple workloads
4. Add one advanced feature of your choice (e.g., stored procedures, triggers)

**Final Milestone:** A functional, albeit basic, relational database management system that demonstrates the core principles of database design and implementation.

## Extension Ideas

Once you've completed the core lessons, consider these extensions:
- Implement a query cache
- Add support for transactions with savepoints
- Create a simple replication system
- Implement a basic distributed query processor
- Add support for JSON or other semi-structured data

## Notes

This curriculum is designed to be challenging but achievable. Focus on understanding the concepts before implementation. Each component builds on previous ones, so ensure you have a solid grasp before moving forward.

Remember that real-world database systems are incredibly complex and optimized over decades. Your implementation will be simpler but should demonstrate the core principles that make databases work.

Good luck on your database building journey!
